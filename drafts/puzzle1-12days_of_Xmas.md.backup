#_Twelve Days of Christmas_


_According to the traditional song, on the first day of Christmas (25th December), my true love sent to me:_

• A partridge in a pear tree

_On the second day of Christmas (26th December), my true love sent to me THREE presents:_

• Two turtle doves
• A partridge in a pear tree

_On the third day of Christmas (27th December and so on) my true love sent to me SIX presents:_

• Three French hens
• Two turtle doves
• A partridge in a pear tree

_This carries on until the the twelfth day of Christmas, when my true love sends me:_

• Twelve drummers drumming
• Eleven pipers piping
• Ten lords a-leaping
• Nine ladies dancing
• Eight maids a-milking
• Seven swans a-swimming
• Six geese a-laying
• Five gold rings
• Four calling birds
• Three French hens
• Two turtle doves
• A partridge in a pear tree

_After the twelve days of Christmas are over, how many presents has my true love sent me altogether?_

1. Strict, hard coded, solution:

```
function allgifts()
    dg = []   # daily gifts storage
    for d in 1:12
        d = sum(1:d)   # daily gifts from day 1 to 12
        push!(dg, d)   # storing each day gifts
    end
    print(sum(dg))   # showing total number of gifts in storage
end

> allgifts()
364
```

2. Generalizing the function for any number of days:

```
function allgifts2(days)
    dg = []   # daily gifts storage
    for d in 1:days
        d = sum(1:d)   # daily gifts from day 1 to days
        push!(dg, d)   # storing each day gifts
    end
    print(sum(dg))   # showing total number of gifts in storage
end

# There are actually 13 days from 25 Dec to 6 Jan
# Let's add to the list Thirteen puzzlers puzzling
