#_Pencils and Jars_

_I have some pencils and some jars._

_If I put 9 pencils into each jar I will have two jars left over._

_If I put 6 pencils into each jar I will have three pencils left over._

_How many pencils and how many jars?_


Solution:

```
function pencilsonjars()
    for p in 1:100
        for j in 1:50
            if p/9 == j-2 && (p-3)/6 == j
                print(p, " pencils and ", j, " jars.")
            end
        end
    end
end

> pencilsonjars()
45 pencils and 7 jars.
```


There are 45 pencils and 7 jars.
