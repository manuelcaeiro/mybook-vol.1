#_The Cashier's Problem_

_An old man goes to a bank with a check of $200 and asks the cashier "Give me some one-dollar bills, ten times as many twos and the balance in fives!"._

_What will the cashier do?_

Solution:

Because the balance is in 'fives', the subtotal of 'ones' and 'twos' must be a multiple of 5, and there is only one number that fulfils that condition in the given interval 1 to 200.


```
function condcashdraw()
    for x in 1:20
        for y in 1:50
            if x*(1+20) % 5 == 0 && x*(1+20) + y*(5) == 200
                println("\$1 bills:  ", x)
                println("\$2 bills: ", x*10)
                println("\$5 bills: ", y)
            end
        end
    end
end

> condcashdraw()
$1 bills:  5
$2 bills: 50
$5 bills: 19
```


The answer for the puzzle:
The cashier shall give the man five $1 bills, fifty $2 bills and nineteen $5 bills; 5 + (50 x 2) + (19 x 5) = 5 + 100 + 95 = 200 dollars.
