#_Five Girl's Individual Weights_

_The five school children in couples weigh 129 pounds, 125 pounds, 124 pounds, 123 pounds, 122 pounds, 121 pounds, 120 pound, 118 pounds, 116 pounds and 114 pounds on a weighing machine._

I don't know if this was Sam Loyd's original text for the puzzle, but it seems a little incomplete.
The descending order of the pair's weights permits to deduce that the girls wanted to take advantage of one single coin on the weighing machine, which will display lower weights but not higher. So, we may also presume that the girls ordered from the heaviest to the lightest.
Let's follow that descending order and give the girls alphabetical names: Anna, Beatrice, Caroline, Daphne and Elizabeth.

Solution.

1. First we get the weights of the 3 heaviest girls as follow:

```
function girlsweights1()
    for A in 1:100
        for B in 1:100
            for C in 1:100
                if A+B == 129 && A+C == 125 && B+C == 124
                    println("Anna's weight is ", A)
                    println("Beatrice's weight is ", B)
                    println("Caroline's weight is ", C)
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

> girlsweights1()
Anna's weight is 65
Beatrice's weight is 64
Caroline's weight is 60
```

2. Now let's do identically for the 3 lightest girls:

```
function girlsweights2()
    for C in 1:100
        for D in 1:100
            for E in 1:100
                if C+D == 118 && C+E == 116 && D+E == 114
                    println("Caroline's weight is ", C)
                    println("Daphne's weight is ", D)
                    println("Elizabeth's weight is ", E)
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

> girlsweights2()
Caroline's weight is 60
Daphne's weight is 58
Elizabeth's weight is 56
```

We must have done it right because Caroline's weight was calculated the same, 60.

Answer for the puzzle: 
The girls individual weights are 65, 64, 60, 58 and 56 pounds.
