# _Swim Speed_

_If Sarah can swim 4 kilometre downstream (with the current) in a river in 30 minutes, & upstream 1.6 kilometre (against the current) in 15 minutes, how long would it take her to swim 1 Kilometre in still water?_

Let's take this question to exemplify a more general way of using code to solve mathematics puzzles, which will allow to solve other puzzles about speed and average speed.

1. Start by calculating the partial speeds (in Km/hour) from the known distances and times.

```
function speed(dist, time)
    # input distance in Kilometers and time in minutes
    # to get Km/h
    speed = (60 * dist) / time
    print(speed, " Km/h")
end

# > speed(4, 30)
# 8.0 Km/h
# > speed(1, 15)
# 4.0 Km/h
```

2. Now let's use the function bellow to calculate Sarah's average speed, which shall probably be the speed in still water.

```
function average(a, b, x...)
    speeds = (a, b, x...)
    average = sum(speeds) / length(speeds)
    print("The average speed is: ", average, " Km/h")
end

# > average(8, 4)
# The average speed is: 6.0 Km/h
```

3. Now let's use again the function bellow to calculate the time Sarah will take at that speed to swim 1600 Km in the pool.

```
function time(dist, speed)
    # distance input in meters
    time = dist * 60 / speed
    print("Sarah shall swim ", dist, " Km in ", time)
    print(" minutes, in still waters.")
end

# > time(100, 6)
# Sarah shall swim 100 meters in 1.0 minutes, in still waters.*
```

* Which is quite good considering that the 100 meters freestyle world record is 51.71 seconds, and  belongs (presently) to (guess who) Sarah Sjöström. :)

P.S.: The speed of the current is 8 - 6 = 2 or 6 - 4 = 2 Km/h
