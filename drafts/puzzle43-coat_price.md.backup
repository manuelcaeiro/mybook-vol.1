#_The Price of the Coat_

_A man is paid Rs. 24000 plus one coat for one year service. However he left after 9 months and receives Rs. 15000 and a coat.

_Then find the price of the coat._


Solution:

- Say _c_ is the price of the coat;
- The man worked 3/4 of one year, he should receive Rs. 24000*(3/4)+1 coat, i.e. Rs. 18000+1 coat;
- He actually received Rs 15000+1 coat.


```
function coatprice()
    for c in 1:50000
        if 3/4*(24000 + c) == 15000 + c
            print("The price of the coat is Rs. ", c)
        end
    end
end

> coatprice()
The price of the coat is Rs. 12000
