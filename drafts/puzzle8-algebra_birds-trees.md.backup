#_Birds on Trees_

_There are 2 trees in a garden (tree "A" and "B") and on the both trees are some birds._

_The birds of tree A say to the birds of tree B that if one of you comes to our tree, then our population will be the double of yours._

_Then the birds of tree B tell to the birds of tree A that if one of you comes here, then our population will be equal to that of yours._

_How many birds are there on each tree?_



```
function birdsOnTrees()
    for n in 1:10
        for m in 1:10
            if (n+1) == 2*(m-1) && (m+1) == (n-1)
                print("Tree A: ", n, " birds", ", ", "Tree B: ", m, " birds")
            end
        end
    end
end

# > birdsOnTrees()
# Tree A: 7 birds, Tree B: 5 birds
