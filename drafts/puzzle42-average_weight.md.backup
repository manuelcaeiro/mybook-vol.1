#_Students Weight's Averages_

_When a student weighing 54 kg left a class, the average weight of the remaining 59 students increased by 100g._

_What is the average weight of the remaining 59 students?_


Solution:

- Let _a_ be the average weight of the 59 students (after the 54 Kg student left the class),
- The average weight of the 60 students will be equal to 59 times the average of the 59 plus 54 Kg, all divided by 60, i.e. (59*a+54)/60 ...
- ... which is told to be the same as the average weight of the 59 less 0.1 Kg.


```
function averweight()
    for a in 1:50
        if (59*a + 54)/60 == a - 0.1
            println("The average weight of the 59 students is ", a, " Kg.")
            println("The average weight of the 60 students was ", a-0.1, " Kg.")
        end
    end
end

> averweight()
The average weight of the 59 students is 60 Kg.
The average weight of the 60 students was 59.9 Kg.
```


So, the total weight decreased 54 Kg, but the average weight increased from 59.9 to 60 Kg.
