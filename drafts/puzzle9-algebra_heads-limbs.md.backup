#_E.T. Headers & Leggers_

_On the planet Glogg, the inhabitants are similar to human beings, however they differ in one respect:_

_- they either have 3 heads and the usual number of arms and legs (known as "headers") OR_

_- they have one head and 3 legs and 3 arms (known as "leggers")._

_Last week, I was talking to a group of friends from the planet and between them they had 15 heads and 48 limbs._

_How many headers and how many leggers were there?_

_Puzzle Author: Stephen Froggatt_

To find the solution for this puzzle we have to do a little math first and try to formulate two suitable equations:

- We know that for each head of a "legger"  the total he (L) there are three heads of a "header" (H), and that the total number of heads is 15.

L + (3 x H) = 15

- we also know that for each four limbs of a "header" there are six limbs of a "legger", and the total number of limbs is 48.

(4 x H) + (6 x L) = 48


```
function countET()
    for L in 1:10
        for H in 1:10
            if 3 * H + L == 15 && 4 * H + 6 * L == 48
                print("Headers: ", H, ", ", "Leggers: ", L)
            end
        end
    end
end
    
# > countET()
# Headers: 3, Leggers: 6
```
