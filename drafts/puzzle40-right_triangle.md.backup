#_Right Angle Triangle_

_The lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle are natural numbers._

_The length of one of the perpendicular sides is 10._

_Find the length of the remaining sides of this triangle._

Solution:

- Let's call _a_ and _b_ to the perpendicular sides of the triangle, and _h_ to its hypotenuse.

- The [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) states that the sum of the squares of the perpendicular sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, i.e. a^2+b^2=h^2.

- Knowing that a=10 the equation can be written as h^2-b^2=100.


```
function trianglesides()
    for b in 1:50
        for h in 1:100
            if h^2-b^2 == 100
                print("b = ", b, "; ", "h = ", h)
            end
        end
    end
end

> trianglesides()
b = 24; h = 26
```


The sides of this triangle are: 
short leg = 10, long leg = 24, hypotenuse = 26
