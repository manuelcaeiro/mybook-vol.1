#_Find the numbers (1)_

ABCD Ã— E = DCBA

_Replace letters with digits and have the answer be true. A,B,C,D and E are all different digits._


```
function findABCDxE()
    # all 4 digit numbers
    for n in 1000:9999
        # 1 is neutral element of multiplication (a)
        for m in 2:9
            s = string(n)   # turn n into a string...
            r = reverse(s)   # ... so you can reverse it
            # turn the reversed string into a number
            p = parse(Int64, r)
            # another way of saying ABCD x E = DCBA
            if n * m == p
                println(n, "*", m, "=", p)
            end
        end
    end
end
    
# > findABCDxE()
# 1089*9=9801
# 2178*4=8712
```

(a) Multiplying by 1 would return as results the (long) list of all symetric numbers, from 1001 to 9999, and we don't want that.
