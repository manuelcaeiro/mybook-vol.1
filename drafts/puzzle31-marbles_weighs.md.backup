#_Weighing With Marbles_

_•	 If a top and three cubes equal in weight to 12 marbles (the scales balance),_

_• and a top is equal in weight to a cube and eight marbles (the scales balance),_

_• how many marbles would be needed to balance with a top?_

Solution:

```
 function marblesweigh()
    for c in 1:10
        for t in 1:10
            if 3c + t == 12 && t == 8 + c
                print("To balance a top ", t, " marbles will be needed.") 
            end
        end
    end
end

> marblesweigh()
To balance a top 9 marbles will be needed.
```


Note: A cube and a marble weigh the same.
