# _Puzzling Legacies_

_A man bequeathed a sum of money, a little less than £1,500, to be divided as follows:_

_The five children and the lawyer received such sums that the square root of the eldest son's share, the second son's share divided by two, the third son's share plus £2, the fourth son's share minus £2, the daughter's share multiplied by 2, and the square of the lawyer's fee all worked out to at exactly the same sum of money._

_No pounds were divided, and no money was left over after the division. What was the total amount bequeathed?_

_author: H. Dudeney_


Solution:

- Say that the amounts to be received were _E_ by the eldest son, _S_ by the second son, and _L_ by the lawyer;
- It is said that _the square root of the eldest son's share_ is equal to _the second son's share divided by two_, i.e. sqrt(E)=S/2;
- It is also said that _the second son's share divided by two_ is equal to _the square of the lawyer's fee_, i.e. S/2=L^2 which is the same as S=2*(L^2);
- All the other values can be extrapolated from these.


```
function dividelegacy()
    println("The bequeathed money was divided the following way:")
    for E in 1000:1500
        for S in 10:100
            for L in 1:50
                if sqrt(E) == S/2 && S == 2*(L^2)
                    println("Eldest son, £", E)
                    println("Second son, £", S)
                    println("Third son, £", L^2+2)
                    println("Fourth son, £", L^2-2)
                    println("Daughter, £", floor(Int, S/4))
                    println("Lawyer, £", L, "\n")
                    println("And the total was £", E+S+(L^2+2)+(L^2-2)+floor(Int,S/4)+L)
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

> dividelegacy()
The bequeathed money was divided the following way:
Eldest son, £1296
Second son, £72
Third son, £38
Fourth son, £34
Daughter, £18
Lawyer, £6

And the total was £1464
```


The answer for the puzzle: The total amount bequeathed was £1464.
