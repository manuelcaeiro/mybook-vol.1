# _Intro_

Dear reader,

The purpose of this book is to share some amusement by showing how mathematical puzzles can be solved using Julia programming language.

If your intention is to [learn](https://juliaacademy.com/courses), or [deepen your learning](https://www.linuxlinks.com/excellent-free-books-learn-julia/) of Julia there are excellent free resources available. The same way, if you intend to [learn](https://schoolyourself.org/) or [deepen your learning](https://www.openculture.com/free-math-textbooks) of mathematics there are hundreds of free courses and books attainable.

For this first volume were chosen mainly easy and medium difficulty (along with a couple of more difficult) puzzles, just to warm up for the second volume which is planned to contain some original problems. The author resisted the temptation of ordering the problems by it's (theoretical) degree of difficulty trying to avoid the reader getting to some page where he gives up, as frequently happens. This way, hopefully the reader turns the page, finds an easier puzzle, and gets to the end of the book.

As [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) said, "There should be no such thing as boring mathematics."

"Mathematics knows no races or geographic boundaries; for mathematics, the cultural world is one country", stated [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert).

[Shakuntala Devi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuntala_Devihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuntala_Devi) puts it this way: "What is mathematics? It is only a systematic effort of solving puzzles posed by nature."

Have fun.
