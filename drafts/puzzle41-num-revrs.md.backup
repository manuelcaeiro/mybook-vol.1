#_Number and Reverse_

_When the units and tens digits of a certain two-digit number are reversed, the sum of the two numbers is 121 and the difference is 9._

_What is the tens digit of the original number?_


Solution:

```
function numandreverse()
    print("Two numbers fulfil the conditions: ")
    for n in 11:99
        rsn = reverse(string(n))
        if parse(Int, rsn) + n == 121 && abs(parse(Int, rsn) - n) == 9
            print(n, "  ")
        end
    end
end

> numandreverse()
Two numbers fulfil the conditions: 56  65
```


The answer for the puzzle:
The tens digit(s) of the original numbers(s) are 6 and 5.
