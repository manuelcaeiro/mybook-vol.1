#_The Price of Eggs_

_This odd little problem in domestic arithmetic was sprung by the cook upon Mrs. Smith when she wanted to know what the grocer charged for such small eggs._

_"I paid twelve cents for the lot," replied Bridget, "but I made him throw in two extra ones, because they were so little, and you see that made them cost one cent a dozen less than his first asking price_

_Tell now how many eggs she received for her twelve cents?_

Solution:

- Let _x_ be the number of eggs offered by the grocer for 12 cents;
- The price of a dozen would be, then 12 cents divided by the number of dozens, that is, 12/(x/12);
- If we add to _x_ the 2 extra eggs that the cook demanded, the price for a dozen would be 1 cent less, that is, 12/((x+2)/12), and if we add that cent less the price for a dozen will be equal in both cases.

```
function eggsprice()
    for x in 1:20
        if 12/(x/12) == 12/((x+2)/12)+1
            println("The grocer offered ", x, " eggs for 12 cents.")
            println("The cook recieved ", x+2, " eggs for the same price.")
            println("The price of a dozen in the first case is ", 12/(x/12), " cents.")
            println("The price of a dozen in the second case is ", 12/((x+2)/12), " cents.")
        end
    end
end

> eggsprice()
The grocer offered 16 eggs for 12 cents.
The cook recieved 18 eggs for the same price.
The price of a dozen in the first case is 9.0 cents.
The price of a dozen in the second case is 8.0 cents.
```


The answer for the puzzle:
The cook received 18 eggs for 12 cents.
