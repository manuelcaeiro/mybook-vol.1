#_Find the Big Number_

_ What 5 - digit number has the following features :_

_If we put the numeral 1 at the beginning, we get a number three times smaller than if we put the numeral 1 at the end of the number?_

Let's do some thinking and see this graphically:

- 1abcde * 3 = abcde1
- Notice that the 1 in 1abcde is in the 6th position to the left. So, 1abcde = 100000 + abcde
- In the same way, the 1 in abcde1 is in the 1st position on the right. So, abcde1 = abcde + 1
- Now let's replace the series of unknown digits abcde by A
- And we can write it as (100000 + A) * 3 = 10 * A + 1

All we need to know is the what 5 digits number A represents.

Solution:

```
function findnumber()
    for A in 1:99999
        if 3 * (100000+A) == A * 10 + 1
            print(A)
        end
    end
end

> findnumber()
42857

# Check if it is true
> 3 * 142857
428571
```
