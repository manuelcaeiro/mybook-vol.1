#_Farmer Factor_

_Farmer Factor (who lives at Fraction Farm) wants to stock up on feed for his three types of animals (chickens, pigs, cows)._

_His goal is to spend all of the $100 and get exactly 100 bags altogether to fill up his cart._

_Naturally, each type of animal food is a different price. How does he spend his money?_

Solution:

- Let _c_ be the number of bags of chicken food, _p_ the number of bags of pig food and _C_ the number of bags of cow food. Half of the total number of bags of animal food is 50, so 0.5xc+0.5xp+0.5xC=50 bags;
- Taking the prices for each kind of food-bag and the total spent being $100, then $5xc+$3xp+0.5xC=$100.


```
function foodbags()
    for c in 1:100
        for p in 1:100
            for C in 1:100
                if 5c+3p+0.5C == 100 && 0.5c+0.5p+0.5C == 50
                    println(c, " chicken food bags, amounting \$", 5c)
                    println(p, " pig food bags, amounting \$", 3p)
                    println(C, " cow food bags, amounting \$", Int(0.5C))
                    println("Total bags: ", c, "+", p, "+", C, "=", c+p+C)
                    println("Total price: ", 5c, "+", 3p, "+", Int(0.5C), "=\$", 5c+3p+0.5C)
                    return
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

> foodbags()
5 chicken food bags, amounting $25
11 pig food bags, amounting $33
84 cow food bags, amounting $42
Total bags: 5+11+84=100
Total price: 25+33+42=$100.0
```
