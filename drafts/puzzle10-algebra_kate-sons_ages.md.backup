#_Kate's and Son's ages_

_5 years ago Kate was 5 times as old as her Son._

_In 5 years her age will be 8 less than three times her Son's age at that time._

_How old are Kate and her Son now?_

_Puzzle Author: Stephen Froggatt_

Let K and S be the ages of Kate and her son at present.

So, Kate's age five years ago was five times her son's age five years ago:

K - 5 = (S - 5) * 5

And Kate's age in five years will be three times her son's age in five years minus eight:

K + 5 = (S + 5) * 3 - 8


```
function relativeAges()
    for K in 1:50
        for S in 1:25
            if K - 5 == (S - 5) * 5 && K + 5 == (S + 5) * 3 - 8
                print("Kate's age is ", K, " | ", "Son's age is ", S)
            end
        end
    end
end
    
# > relativeAges()
# Kate's age is 35 | Son's age is 11
```
