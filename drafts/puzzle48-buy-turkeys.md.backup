#_Buying Turkeys_

_A man bought a number of turkeys at a cost of £60, and after reserving fifteen of the birds he sold the remainder for £54, thus gaining 2s. a head by these._

_How many turkeys did he buy?_

_author: H. Dudeney_


Solution:

- £60 is equal to 1200 shillings, £54 is equal to 1080 shillings;
- Let the number of turkeys be _T_;
- Then, the buying price of one turkey was 1200/T, and its selling price was (T-15)/1080;
- As the buying price was 2 shillings less than the selling price, the following must be true: (1200/T)+2 = 1080/(T-15).


```
function turkeys()
    for T in 1:200
        if (1200/T)+2 == 1080/(T-15)
            println("He bought ", T, " turkeys, at ", 1200/T, " shillings each.")
            println("He sold ", T-15, " turkeys, at ", 1080/(T-15), " shillings each.")
        end
    end
end

> turkeys()
He bought 75 turkeys, at 16.0 shillings each.
He sold 60 turkeys, at 18.0 shillings each.
```


The man bought 75 turkeys.
