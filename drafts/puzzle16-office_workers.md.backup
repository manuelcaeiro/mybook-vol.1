#_Office Workers_
	
_There are as many four-legged chairs and as many four-legged tables as workers in the office of Yamraj, and as many three-legged stools as four-legged office closets._

_If the number of stools is one more than number of workers and the total number of legs is 585, then what is the number of workers in the office?_


Solution:

```
function officeworkers()
    for w in 1:50
        for tc in 1:100
            for s in 1:50
                for c in 1:50
                    if w*2 + tc*4 + c*4 + s*3 == 585 && s == w+1 && tc == w*2 && s == c
                        println("Number of workers is: ", w)
                        println("There are also:")
                        println(tc, " tables and chairs,")
                        println(s, " stools, and")
                        println(c, " office closets.")
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

> officeworkers()
Number of workers is: 34
There are also:
68 tables and chairs,
35 stools, and
35 office closets.
```


The answer for the puzzle:
There are 34 workers in the office.
