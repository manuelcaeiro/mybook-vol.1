#_Horses and Bullocks_

_A dealer bought a number of horses at £17, 4s. each, and a number of bullocks at £13, 5s. each._

_He then discovered that the horses had cost him in all 33s. more than the bullocks._

_Now, what is the smallest number of each he must have bought?_

Solution:

- First reduce the amounts to shillings: 20x17+4=344s for each horse and 20x13+5=265s for each bullock;
- Next assign variables _H_ to number of horses and _B_ to the number of bullocks;
- The indeterminate equation 344H = 265B + 33 must then be true. 


```
function horsesandbulls()
    for H in 1:500
        for B in 1:500
            if 344H == 265B+33
                println("He must have bought ", H, " horses,")
                println("and ", B, " bullocks.")
                println("The horses cost in total \$", 252*344)
                println("The bulls cost in total \$", 327*265)
                println("and the difference is \$", 252*344-327*265)
            end
        end
    end
end

> horsesandbulls()
He must have bought 252 horses,
and 327 bullocks.
The horses cost in total $86688
The bulls cost in total $86655
and the difference is $33
```


The smallest number of animals the dealer must have bought is 252 horses and 327 bullocks.
