#_Blueberries on Cups_

_Maria has some blueberries and some cups. If she puts 9 blueberries into each cup she will have two cups left. If she puts 6 blueberries into each cup she will have three blueberries left over._

_How many blueberries and cups has Maria?_

So:

1. The number of groups of nine berries is equal to the number of cups minus two.
2. The number of berries minus three, divided in groups of six is equal to the number of cups.


```
function berriesincups()
    for c in 1:20
        for b in 10:100
            if b/9 == c-2 && (b-3)/6 == c
                print("Maria has ", c, " cups and ", b, " blueberries.")
            end
        end
    end
end

> berriesincups()
Maria has 7 cups and 45 blueberries.

# Check if it is true
> 45 / 9
5   # groups of 9 in 5 cups
> 5 + 2
7   # cups in total
