#_The Picnic_

_Four married couples had a picnic together, and their refreshments included thirty-two bottles of lemonade._

_Mary only disposed of one bottle, Anne had two, Jane swallowed the contents of three, and Elizabeth emptied four bottles._

_The husbands were more thirsty, except John MacGregor, who drank the same quantity as his better half._

_Lloyd Jones drank twice as much as his wife, William Smith three times as much as his wife, and Patrick Dolan four times as much as his wife demanded._

_The puzzle is to find the surnames of the ladies._

_Which man was married to which woman?_

Solution:

- Let _a, b, c_ and _d_ represent the bottles of lemonade each lady  drank;
- Therefore, a+b+c+d=10 bottles, 
- and a+2b+3c+4d=22 is the number of bottles their husbands drank.


```
function lemonades()
    for a in 1:4
        for b in 1:4
            for c in 1:4
                for d in 1:4
                    if a+b+c+d == 10 && a+2b+3c+4d == 22 && a!=b && a!=c && a!=d && b!=c && b!=d && c!=d
                        println("Jane and John drank ", a, " lemonades each")
                        println("Elizabeth drank ", b, " and Lloyd ", 2b)
                        println("Mary drank ", c, " and William ", 3c)
                        println("Anne drank ", d, " and Patrick ", 4d)
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

> lemonades()
Jane and John drank 3 lemonades each
Elizabeth drank 4 and Lloyd 8
Mary drank 1 and William 3
Anne drank 2 and Patrick 8
```

The answer for the puzzle:

- John MacGregor was married to Jane.
- Lloyd Jones was married to Elizabeth.
- William Smith was marries to Mary.
- Patrick Dolan was marries to Anne.
