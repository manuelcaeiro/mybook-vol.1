#_Battle of Hastings Squares_

_Sam Loyd's Battle of Hastings Puzzle
In the Battle of Hastings that occurred on October 14, 1066 Harold's forces formed 13 similar squares with exactly same number of soldiers in each square._

_When Harold himself joined the fray and was added to the number of his soldiers in those thirteen squares a single huge square could be arranged. How many men there must have been in Harold's force?_

Solution:

All we have to do is find some number _x_ which squared, multiplied by thirteen and added of one is a perfect square. 

```
function battlesquares()
    for x in 1:1000
        if string(sqrt((x^2 * 13) + 1))[end]  == '0' && string(sqrt((x^2 * 13) + 1))[end-1] == '.'
            bigsq = x^2 * 13 + 1
            bigsqside = trunc(Int,(sqrt(x^2 * 13 + 1)))
            smsqs = x^2
            smsqside = x
            println("Total men in 'a single huge square': ", bigsq)
            println("With ", bigsqside, " on each side.")
            println("Number of men on each of the 13 small squares; ", smsqs)
            println("With ", smsqside, " on each side.")
        end
    end
end

> battlesquares()
Total men in 'a single huge square': 421201
with 649 men on each side.
Number of men on each of the 13 small squares: 32400
with 180 men on each side.
```

The answer for the puzzle:
The total men in Harold's force must have been 421201.
